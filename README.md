# Plotly-Deployment: Web Visualizations of Bacterial Species

## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
To help Roza create an interactive data visualization of bacterial species database by using Plotly.js library in JavaScript and utilize HTML to showcase these visualizations on a webpage. The visualizations are based on the user's selected ID of the test subject on the web. The sample database contains the bacterial species found in the belly button of volunteers across the country.

### Resources:

+ **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
+ **Library:** Plotly.js
+ **Editor Tool:** Visual Studio Code
+ **Database:** [samples.json](https://github.com/asama-w/plotly_deploy/blob/main/samples.json)
+ **Scripts:**
	+ [index.html](https://github.com/asama-w/plotly_deploy/blob/main/index.html) 
	+ [charts.js](https://github.com/asama-w/plotly_deploy/blob/main/charts.js)
	+ [style.css](https://github.com/asama-w/plotly_deploy/blob/main/css/style.css)

### Web Deployment
The interactive webpage can be reached here: [Bellybutton_Biodiversity](https://asama-w.github.io/plotly_deploy/index.html)

### Overview of the Customized Webpage

The visualizations of each volunteer's bacterial species and their demographic information will change as per selected ID in the Test Subject ID's dropdown list. By clicking `Dashboard Home` on the top-left corner, the webpage will reload the visualizations of the default ID which is ID 940.
